<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 1, 4 Butanediol Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reppe process</li><li>Davy process</li><li>Butadiene process</li><li>Propylene oxide process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>1,4-Butanediol is produced using four main processes: the Reppe process, Davy process, Butadiene process, and Propylene oxide process.</p><p>The Reppe process involves the reaction of acetylene with formaldehyde to produce gamma-butyrolactone, which is then hydrogenated to form 1,4-Butanediol. The Davy process involves the catalytic hydrogenation of succinic acid or succinic anhydride. The Butadiene process uses butadiene as a starting material for the production of 1,4-Butanediol. The Propylene oxide process involves the use of propylene oxide as a starting material to produce 1,4-Butanediol.</p></p>
