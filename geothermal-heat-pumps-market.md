<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geothermal Heat Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical Closed Loop</li><li>Horizontal Closed Loop</li><li>Open Loop</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geothermal heat pumps are categorized into three main types based on their loop system: Vertical Closed Loop, Horizontal Closed Loop, and Open Loop. Vertical Closed Loop systems involve drilling deep wells and circulating water or antifreeze to exchange heat with the earth. Horizontal Closed Loop systems utilize horizontal trenches to circulate fluid for heat exchange. Open Loop systems pump groundwater from a well and directly use it for heat exchange before returning it to the ground. Each system offers unique benefits and is chosen based on site-specific factors.</p></p>
