<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flux Cored Welding Wire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gas-shielded</li><li>Self-shielded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flux cored welding wire comes in two main types: gas-shielded and self-shielded. Gas-shielded wire requires an external shielding gas to protect the weld from atmospheric contamination, resulting in cleaner and more consistent welds. On the other hand, self-shielded wire contains a flux core that generates its own shielding gas when heated, making it more convenient for outdoor or windy conditions where external gas shielding may be difficult. Both types have their own advantages and are used in various welding applications based on their specific characteristics.</p></p>
