<p><strong>The Geothermal Power Generation Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Steam Power Stations</li><li>Flash Steam Power Stations</li><li>Binary Cycle Power Stations</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geothermal power generation involves three different types of power stations: Dry Steam, Flash Steam, and Binary Cycle. Dry steam power stations use steam directly from underground reservoirs. Flash steam power stations utilize hot water from reservoirs to generate steam. Binary cycle power stations use the heat from the reservoir to heat a secondary fluid with a lower boiling point, which then drives a turbine to generate electricity. Each of these technologies plays a critical role in the geothermal power generation market.</p></p>
