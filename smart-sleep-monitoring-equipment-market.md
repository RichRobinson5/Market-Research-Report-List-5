<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Sleep Monitoring Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Contactless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Smart sleep monitoring equipment can be broadly categorized into two types: contact and contactless. Contact sleep monitoring devices typically involve physical sensors that come into direct contact with the user's body to measure vital signs and movements during sleep. On the other hand, contactless sleep monitoring devices use non-invasive technology, such as radio frequency or sound waves, to track sleep patterns without the need for physical contact. Both types of equipment offer valuable insights into sleep quality and can help users improve their overall sleep performance.</p></p>
