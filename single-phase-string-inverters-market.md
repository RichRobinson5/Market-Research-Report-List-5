<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single Phase String Inverters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Grid System Type</li><li>Off-Grid System Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single Phase String Inverters are widely used in two main market types: On-Grid System Type and Off-Grid System Type. On-Grid System Type refers to inverters that are connected to the utility grid and feed excess electricity back into the grid. This type is commonly used in residential and commercial buildings where the primary source of electricity is the utility grid. On the other hand, Off-Grid System Type refers to inverters that are not connected to the utility grid and store excess electricity in batteries for later use. This type is commonly used in remote areas where access to the grid is limited or unreliable.</p></p>
