<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vertical Cryogenic Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Submersible</li><li>Non-Submersible</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vertical cryogenic pumps can be classified into two main types based on their design and application: submersible and non-submersible pumps. Submersible pumps are designed to be fully immersed in the cryogenic liquid, allowing for efficient transfer of the liquid from a lower to higher level. Non-submersible pumps, on the other hand, operate externally and are used for transferring cryogenic liquids from one container to another without the need for direct immersion. Both types play a crucial role in various industrial processes requiring cryogenic pumping systems.</p></p>
