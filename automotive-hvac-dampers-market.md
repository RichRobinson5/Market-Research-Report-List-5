<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive HVAC Dampers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Spring Return Damper Actuators</li><li>Spring Return Damper Actuators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive HVAC dampers are used to control the flow of air in a vehicle's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system. Two main types of actuators used in automotive HVAC dampers are non-spring return damper actuators and spring return damper actuators. </p><p>Non-spring return damper actuators are designed to move to a specific position when power is applied and stay in that position until power is removed. Spring return damper actuators, on the other hand, use a spring to return to a default position when power is removed. Both types play a crucial role in regulating air flow in automotive HVAC systems.</p></p>
