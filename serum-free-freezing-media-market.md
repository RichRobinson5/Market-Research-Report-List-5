<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Serum-Free Freezing Media Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With DMSO</li><li>DMSO-free</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Serum-Free Freezing Media is used for preserving cells and tissues during freezing for long-term storage. There are two main types: those containing Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) and those that are DMSO-free. Freezing media with DMSO is widely used because it helps prevent ice crystal formation and cell damage during freezing. However, some researchers prefer DMSO-free freezing media due to concerns about potential toxicity. Both types of freezing media play a crucial role in maintaining the viability and functionality of stored biological samples.</p></p>
