<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Tire Retreading Services Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-cure</li><li>Mold-cure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive tire retreading services offer two main types of processes: pre-cure and mold-cure. In the pre-cure market, a new tread is applied to the tire casing before it is put into a curing chamber. This method provides a uniform and consistently high-quality finish. In the mold-cure market, the new tread rubber is applied directly to the casing before being placed into a mold, where heat and pressure are applied to bond the rubber to the casing. This process typically results in a more durable and long-lasting finish.</p></p>
