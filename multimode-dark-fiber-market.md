<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multimode Dark Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Step-index Multimode Fiber</li><li>Graded-index Multimode Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Multimode Dark Fiber refers to optical fiber that allows multiple modes of light to propagate simultaneously, typically used for short-distance communication. There are two main types of Multimode Dark Fiber: Step-index Multimode Fiber and Graded-index Multimode Fiber. </p><p>Step-index Multimode Fiber has a core with a uniform refractive index, causing light rays to travel in straight paths at various angles. Graded-index Multimode Fiber, on the other hand, has a core with a varying refractive index, allowing light rays to travel in curved paths, reducing modal dispersion and increasing bandwidth.</p></p>
