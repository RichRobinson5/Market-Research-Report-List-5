<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Train Brake System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brakeshoe Brake System</li><li>Disc Brake System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Train Brake System market consists of two main types: Brakeshoe Brake System and Disc Brake System. Brakeshoe Brake System uses friction between a stationary brake shoe and a rotating wheel to slow down or stop the train. On the other hand, Disc Brake System uses calipers to squeeze brake pads against a disc rotor on the wheel to achieve the same effect. Both systems play a crucial role in ensuring the safe operation of trains by providing effective braking capabilities.</p></p>
