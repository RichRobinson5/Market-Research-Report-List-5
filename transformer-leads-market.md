<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transformer Leads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Insulated Lead Cable</li><li>Bare Lead Cable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Transformer leads refer to the cables used to connect a transformer to an external circuit. There are two main types of transformer lead cables: insulated lead cable and bare lead cable. Insualted lead cables are coated with a layer of insulation to protect against electrical shocks and ensure safe operation. On the other hand, bare lead cables do not have insulation and are typically used in applications where the risk of electrical shock is low. Both types of cables play a crucial role in the functioning of transformers.</p></p>
