<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Weighing Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Platform</li><li>Floor-standing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Platform aircraft weighing equipment refers to scales that are designed with a platform on which the aircraft is positioned for weighing. These scales offer flexibility and ease of use. On the other hand, floor-standing aircraft weighing equipment are larger scales that are mounted on the floor and require the aircraft to be positioned directly on the scale. They are more suitable for heavier aircraft and provide higher accuracy. Both types of equipment are essential for ensuring the safety and efficiency of aircraft operations.</p></p>
