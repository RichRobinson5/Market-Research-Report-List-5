<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Vacuum-drum Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automatic</li><li>Automatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rotary vacuum-drum filter market offers two main types: semi-automatic and automatic. Semi-automatic filters require manual intervention for operations like cloth washing and cake discharge, while automatic filters have mechanisms for these processes. Semi-automatic filters are more cost-effective, but require more labor involvement, making them suitable for smaller operations. On the other hand, automatic filters offer higher efficiency and productivity, making them ideal for larger industrial settings where continuous operation is required. Both types cater to different needs and budgets in the filtration industry.</p></p>
