<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Solar Control Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbing Solar Control Glass</li><li>Reflective Solar Control Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive solar control glass is categorized into two main types: absorbing solar control glass and reflective solar control glass. Absorbing solar control glass is designed to absorb solar radiation and prevent it from entering the vehicle, reducing heat and glare inside the car. On the other hand, reflective solar control glass reflects a significant portion of the sun's heat and light away from the vehicle, keeping it cooler and more comfortable. Both types of solar control glass offer effective solutions for managing heat and light in automobiles.</p></p>
