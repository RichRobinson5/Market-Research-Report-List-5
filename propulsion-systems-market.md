<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Propulsion Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Breathing Engines</li><li>Non-Air Breathing Engines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Propulsion systems consist of two main types: air breathing engines and non-air breathing engines. Air breathing engines rely on atmospheric oxygen to function, making them suitable for use in the Earth's atmosphere. Examples include turbojets and turbofans. Non-air breathing engines, on the other hand, do not require oxygen from the atmosphere and can operate in space or other environments lacking oxygen. Examples of non-air breathing engines include rocket engines and ion thrusters. Both types of propulsion systems play crucial roles in various industries, including aerospace and defense.</p></p>
